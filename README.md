# My dotfiles

You always have the option of building your dotfiles repo from scratch, or looking through the work of others for inspiration: https://dotfiles.github.io/

At present, I start with needcaffeine version of this and YADR: https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles

To get started, run:
```bash
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skwp/dotfiles/master/install.sh`"
```
[homebrew][≈] and [Cask][√] gainz; things that should have been part of OS X but Apple left out.

just, run:

```bash
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pretorian/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/brew.sh`"
```
This script is going to take a while to finish but it'll save you several hours of work, especially when you're setting up a new Mac. Run it every now and then to upgrade all your applications.
